# Ratch
This repository contains source code for the HTML5 reproduction of Scratch 2, known as Ratch.
All of the code is currently imported from the Ratch source code at https://repl.it/@powerbox1000/ratch.

# Introduction to Ratch
What is Ratch, you ask? Ratch is basically a HyperText Markup Language Version 5 reproduction of Scratch 2, which included Flash along with it. But the Ratch site removes Flash, which explains it's reputation as a HTML5 site. This repo is not monitored by powerbox1000, though.
